## Dependencies

Before running the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6+
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter notebooks)

You can install these packages using `pip`:


pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk tensorflow keras


## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Dharshanaa-S/fake-news-detection-nlp.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:


cd fake-news-detection-nlp


3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the previous section.

## Usage

The code in this repository provides a basic structure for fake news detection using NLP. You can use it as a starting point for your project. Here's how you can use this code:

### Model Training

If you want to train a new model using your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Create a CSV file with two columns: 'text' (containing the news article text) and 'label' (containing the class, either 'real' or 'fake').

2. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.

4. Open and modify the `train_model.py` script to use your dataset and adjust hyperparameters.

5. Run the training script:

python train_model.py

This will train a classification model using the provided dataset.

### Inference

To use the trained model for inference, follow these steps:

1. Place your test data in a CSV file with the 'text' column.

2. Open and modify the `predict.py` script to load your model and specify the path to your test data.

3. Run the prediction script:


python predict.py

This will output the predictions for each news article.

# Fake News Detection using NLP

This repository contains code for a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system is designed to classify news articles as either real or fake based on the text content. In this section, we'll provide information about the dataset source and a brief description of the task.

## Dataset Source
 
 Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [insert dataset source]. Please provide the source or URL where the dataset can be accessed. It is essential to ensure proper citation and compliance with any licensing terms associated with the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for fake news detection typically consists of news articles or headlines along with corresponding labels that indicate whether the news is real or fake. Here's a brief description of the dataset and the task:

- Dataset Size: The dataset contains a specific number of news articles or headlines. It's essential to mention the size of the dataset, including the number of real and fake news articles.

- Data Format: The dataset is usually provided in a structured format, such as a CSV file. It includes two main columns:
  - Text: This column contains the text content of the news articles or headlines.
  - Label: This column indicates the class of the news, which can be binary, typically 'real' or 'fake'.

- Task: The task of fake news detection is a binary classification problem. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can differentiate between real and fake news articles based on their textual content.

- Data Split: Typically, the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's generalization performance.

- Challenges: Fake news detection using NLP faces challenges such as the presence of misleading information, subtle language cues, and the need for robust feature engineering and modeling techniques.

- Performance Metric: Common performance metrics for fake news detection include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

## Citation

If you use this dataset for your research or project, make sure to properly cite the source and any associated papers or articles related to the dataset. It's crucial to give credit to the creators and contributors of the dataset.

In the README or project documentation, consider adding a "Dataset Citation" section with the relevant information.

## License

It's important to mention any licensing terms associated with the dataset, including whether it's freely available for academic and research purposes or if there are any restrictions on its usage. If the dataset is subject to specific terms and conditions, ensure that users are aware of them.
